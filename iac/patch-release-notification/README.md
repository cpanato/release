# patch-release-notification service

This terraform code deploys the code to notify the K8s community about the cherry pick deadline for the patch releases.

The patch-release-notification code can be found in `cmd/patch-release-notification`

Right now, the terraform is applied manually by the release managers that have access to the AWS account for the SIG-release.
